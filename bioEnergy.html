        The transformation from biomass to biofuel is an extensive and
        encouraging step towards the development of future sustainable energy
        solutions. This renewable and alternative energy provides a solution to
        several environmental, energy, and waste management issues. Created from
        organic materials such as crops, agricultural residues, forestry
        byproducts, and organic waste, biofuel provides a diverse number of
        options for harvesting renewable energy. <br /><br />Solid biofuels,
        such as wood pellets and agricultural residues like straw and corn
        stover(stalks/stems, leaves, unused parts of plants, find common use in
        residential, commercial, and industrial heating applications. Liquid
        biofuels, notably ethanol and biodiesel, are considered a greener
        substitute for gasoline and diesel in the transportation sector.
        Ethanol, primarily produced through the fermentations found in crops, is
        blended with gasoline to reduce emissions and enhance octane ratings.
        Biodiesel, synthesized and produced from vegetable oils or animal fats,
        offers a clean-burning alternative to diesel fuel, contributing to air
        quality improvement and dependence on finite petroleum resources.
        Biogas, the third major sector of biofuels, is mainly generated through
        anaerobic digestion of organic matter. Composed of primary methane and
        carbon dioxide, biogas can be utilized in many applications including
        heating, electricity generation, and as a clean fuel for vehicles.

        These different types of biofuel share a common similarity, being
        derived from organic resources that provide a better alternative than
        their limited counterparts. With many benefits involved with biofuels,
        there also lies an extensive process used to produce these alternative
        fuels. In addition to the many benefits of biofuel technology, biofuel
        is a possible sustainable answer to waste management problems;
        controlling and disposing of organic waste out of the landfill, and
        reducing greenhouse gas. Other examples will be provided in later
        information, including the process for solid biofuels, liquid biofuels,
        and biogasses. With many complex processes, organic resources that are
        often seen as waste can be renewed and turned into more sustainable
        energy, that provides efficient and cost-effective energy.<sup

        Benefits & Limitations of Biofuel
      </h1>

      <p class="details">
        The production of biofuel can greatly differ, depending on which fuel is
        desired. For the process of liquid biofuels, such as biodiesel, or
        bio-ethanol, the process often involves obtaining its original
        component, oftentimes used as vegetable oils or animal fat. For biogas,
        the main component mainly includes any biological wet waste that can be
        decomposed through anaerobic digestion. In this process, bacteria are
        able to digest the waste in low-oxygen environments, creating gasses
        such as methane and carbon dioxide, which can both be used and harvested
        to produce energy and electricity. As for solid biofuels, the main
        component originally comes from solid organic biomass such as plants,
        animal waste, and organic municipal waste. From these three methods,
        they share a similar advantage. These processes often provide effective
        use of biomass resources, which address waste management issues, whilst
        promoting a sustainable environment.<sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup> As
        compared to common greenhouse gasses, biomethane can reduce up to 30 to
        70 percent of average greenhouse gas emissions.
        <sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup>
      </p>

      <br />
      <br />

      <p class="details">
        Despite this, the process of converting these fuels to usable energy
        often requires combustion; there is a significant decrease in emissions
        of greenhouse gasses compared to its fossil fuel counterparts. Compared
        to natural methane, the biomethane created from biogas has great
        potential as a clean energy source for many appliances including
        heating, power generation, and automobile fuel. Compared to common
        greenhouse gasses, biomethane can reduce up to 30 to 86 percent of
        average greenhouse gas emissions in the US.
        <sup><a href="#4">[4]</a></sup> This can help mitigate air pollution and
        lessen the carbon footprint involved in its production. This energy
        source, biofuel, is very flexible as it can be used for automobile fuel,
        heat production, and electricity. Since organic waste is common and can
        often be found in various regions, biofuel systems provide chances for
        localized energy production, enabling local communities to be more
        energy-independent than on centralized power networks.
        <sup><a href="#5">[5]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />

      <p class="details">
        Yet despite the benefits of a greener environment and flexibility, there
        are certain limitations on the production of biofuels. The main drawback
        of the product is the need for a steady supply of organic feedstock to
        maintain production. Though this may not often be an issue for highly
        populated areas, localized regions may have issues meeting the quotas
        required to maintain positive energy production. Similarly, proper
        planning and management are needed due to the potential impact of
        feedstock composition and availability. Most importantly, biofuel
        infrastructure may result in financial difficulties due to the initial
        creation and outgoing expense, especially on small scale. or
        resource-constrained organizations. Yet despite these fuels being
        created from organic waste, there is still the possibility of
        contaminating the environment. Improper biofuel production may produce
        odors and require proper, cautious disposal of digestate by-products.

      <p class="details">
        The production of solid biofuels primarily involves the collection and
        processing of biomass materials. As mentioned previously, these
        materials may range from organic materials such as wood chips,
        agricultural residue, and other solid organic waste. Once collected, the
        materials undergo a drying process such as torrefaction or pyrolysis,
        which involves heating the biomass to temperatures between 200 and 300 C
        in the absence of oxygen to reduce its moisture content. This reduction
        of moisture expels volatile molecules and allows the biomass to be more
        efficient for combustion. Then, the dried biomass is subjected to
        processes such as pelletization of briquetting. The dried biomass is
        then subjected to mechanical processes such as grinding or chopping to
        create manageable feedstock. Under this process, the dried product is
        compressed into small dense pellets or briquettes, that are easy to
        store, transport, and use. Pelletizing involves extruding the biomass
        through a small hole, and then under high pressure and heat, compact
        pellets are formed. Briquetting compresses the dried biomass to a
        larger, and denser block, using a combination of pressure and binding
        agents, to hold the biomass together. These solid biofuels produce
        energy under combustion; the solid biomass reacts rapidly with oxygen
        releasing carbon dioxide, water, and energy. The process of this can be
        seen with the following equation: <sup><a href="#7">[7]</a></sup>

        The equation above shows the process of combustion of biomass. The first
        reactant CH<sub>1.44</sub>O<sub>0.66</sub> represents the organic
        compound undergoing combustion. This reactant is considered to be the
        approximate combustible portion of biomass. However, this chemical
        equation would slightly vary depending on the materials used during the
        process of combustion, resulting in a differing amount of energy. The
        second reactant Oxygen represents the current oxygen from the
        surrounding environment. These reactants combined with a high
        temperature environment of above 600 C, form the following products of
        water vapor and carbon dioxide. Most importantly the (+Heat) shows that
        the combustion reaction is exothermic, releasing heat energy also as a
        product of the reaction. <sup><a href="#8">[8]</a></sup> This heat
        generated can then be used and turned into usable energy through steam
        turbines, CHP systems, or ORC systems. The energy generated from the
        heat from the biomass can then be converted into electricity for a
        variety of uses. Today, solid biofuels are typically used in heating
        stems, or power plants for the generation of electricity.

        The production of ethanol is commonly produced through the fermentation
        of sugars present in crops; ex: corn, and sugarcane. This process first
        begins with the extraction of sugar from the biomass; once extracted,
        the sugar is fermented by microorganisms, generally bacteria and yeast,
        to produce ethanol and carbon dioxide. For the process of corn ethanol
        production, the corn is first milled and processed to release the
        starch, allowing enzymes to convert it to simple sugars. Yeast is then
        added to the sugar solution, which is then fermented into ethanol and
        carbon dioxide.

        The reactant or substrate for fermentation in this equation is glucose.
        This molecule is further broken down under the anaerobic condition
        mentioned above. As a result, Ethanol (2C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH) is
        created as a product of fermentation, with Carbon Dioxide
        (2CO<sub>2</sub>) released as a byproduct and waste during the breakdown
        of glucose. This process typically requires anaerobic conditions for
        fermentation and often results in a mixture that contains 10-15%
        ethanol. (Ethanol Production) Another process mentioned previously,
        transesterification, is often used to produce biodiesel from vegetable
        oils and animal fats. In this process, the fats or oils react with
        alcohol (often methanol) in the presence of a catalyst from biodiesel
        and glycerol. This process can be simplified to triglyceride (fat/oil) +
        methanol → biodiesel + glycerol.

        Biogasses require certain oxygen conditions in which a biological
        process occurs in the absence of oxygen, where microorganisms break down
        organic matter into biogas, primarily consisting of methane (CH4) and
        carbon dioxide (CO2), along with trace amounts of other gasses.
        <sup><a href="#14">[14]</a></sup
        >. Currently, transportation contributes to roughly 29% of the total
        greenhouse emissions in the US. With the addition of biofuel sources,
        the total greenhouse emission from transportation can be drastically
        decreased by up to 6%<sup><a href="#15">[15]</a></sup
        >. This process of producing biogas, like the previous fuels, requires
        collecting materials which can include agricultural waste, manure,
        municipal waste, plant material, sewage, or food waste. These materials
        are then placed into a digester tank, where conditions including
        temperature and pH are controlled to optimize the activity of anaerobic
        bacteria. With a temperature range of around 31 to 34 C and a pH range
        of between 7.6 and 8.0, the digestion process begins and is separated
        into four major stages: hydrolysis, acidogenic, acetogenesis, and
        methanogenesis. <sup><a href="#16">[16]</a></sup> Hydrolysis, the initial

        The second stage, acidogenesis uses the previously soluble products from
        hydrolysis, in which acidogenic/ fermentive bacteria further ferment and
        break down the simpler molecules. These bacteria ferment the molecules
        into volatile fatty acids (VFA) such as acetic acid, propionic acid, and
        butyric acid. This fermentation also produces alcohol, hydrogen, and
        carbon dioxide. As a result, the pH level of the digestion tank
        decreases due to the accumulation of these acids.

        Once the substrates are transformed, the final stage occurs,
        methanogenesis. This final stage of anaerobic digestion involves
        methanogenic archaea converting the previous stage's acetic acid,
        hydrogen, and carbon dioxide into methane and carbon dioxide, which
        therefore creates/biogas. At this stage, there are two main pathways for
        methane production, including acetoclastic methanogenesis where methane
        is produced by splitting acetic acids into methane and carbon dioxide,
        and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, in which methane can be produced
        from carbon dioxide and hydrogen. These four stages all are sensitive
        processes, greatly influenced by the digester's environmental
        conditions.<sup><a href="#20">[20]</a></sup>

        Converting From Biofuel to Electricity
      </h1>

      <p class="details">
        As mentioned above, the conversion of solid biofuels, such as wood
        pellets/ agricultural residue requires combustion in which they are
        burned in the presence of oxygen to release heat. Once the solid biofuel
        becomes ignited, and provided enough oxygen, an oxidation reaction
        occurs. This breaks down the solid fuel, breaking down complex organic
        molecules into simpler compounds, releasing heat energy. This heat
        generated from the combustion can then be used to produce electricity,
        by using mechanical energy. The heat can be used to produce steam, which
        can then generate mechanical energy through turbines, or electrical
        generators. The pressure from the increasing amount of steam in turbines
        converts the thermal energy of steam to mechanical energy which is then
        transformed into electricity through electromagnetic induction in
        generators. <sup><a href="#23">[23]</a></sup>

        However, the conversion of liquid biofuels such as ethanol or biodiesel
        follows a different process for the conversion of fuel into electricity.
        The process by which liquid biofuels can be converted is known as
        gasification, producing biogas. This biogas can then be converted into
        electricity. Gasification is a process that requires the partial
        oxidation of the liquid biofuel in a high-temperature environment, in
        the presence of steam and oxygen. (Thermochemical) For simplicity,
        gasification involves the breakdown of liquid biofuel molecules into
        components through pyrolysis( decomposition of organic material in an
        oxygen-deficient environment under high temperatures), reforming, and
        water-gas shift reactions (chemical reaction in which CO reacts with H2O
        to produce CO2 and H2 gas under high temperature). As a result of
        gasification, the liquid biofuels are now a gaseous-like mixture known
        as syngas, which is further processed to remove impurities, while
        increasing methane content, thus creating biogas.<sup
          ><a href="#24">[24]</a></sup
        >
        Like solid biofuel conversion, biogas can be converted into electricity
        by combustion. However, prior to conversion, the biogas requires
        extensive purification such as scrubbing, adsorption, and membrane
        filtration to increase the methane content. Once purified, the gas can
        be used to generate electricity through combustion in gas engines or
        turbines. Like prior methods, mechanical energy requires pressure,
        continuous movement, and heat.<sup><a href="##25">[25]</a></sup>

        The electrical output of a biofuel greatly varies depending on many
        factors including its type, quality, amount, as well as efficiency of
        conversion. Assuming that the solid biofuel is being converted to
        electrical energy by combustion, and mainly consists of plant-based
        components such as wood; averages around 4.63- 5.1229 kWh per kg.
        However, this output will vary depending on the materials/composition
        used as well as the moisture content of the solid biofuel. Similarly,
        the electrical output will also vary for liquid biofuels such as ethanol
        and biodiesel, depending on temperature, and quality. From an average
        value of various sources found online, biodiesel outputs an estimated
        7.8944 kWh per kg . Ethanol produces roughly 6.5 MWh - 7.444 MWh per kg.
        Similarly, biogas output will also vary depending on the quality and
        materials used before production. Since biogas is a gas, the energy
        output would be measured in terms of the volume of cubic meters. The
        output for biogas ranges from 2.14 - 6 kWh per cubic meter of biogas
        (commonly biomethane).<sup><a href="#27">[27]</a></sup>
